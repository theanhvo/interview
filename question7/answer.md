# Microservice-Based Multi-Channel Notification System

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The system uses a **microservice architecture** with **event-driven communication** to create a scalable, resilient notification platform that meets the 99.9% uptime requirement and handles millions of notifications daily.

### Microservice Components

#### 1. Notification Gateway Service
- Acts as entry point for notification requests
- Handles authentication, validation, and rate limiting
- Routes notifications to appropriate channels based on user preferences
- Publishes events to message broker

#### 2. User Preference Service
- Manages user notification preferences
- Stores channel preferences by notification type
- Handles quiet hours and priority settings
- Provides cached preference data to other services

#### 3. Channel-Specific Microservices
- **Email Service**: Handles email template rendering and delivery
- **SMS Service**: Manages SMS formatting and provider integration
- **Push Notification Service**: Handles device token management and push delivery
- **In-App Notification Service**: Manages in-app notification center and real-time delivery

#### 4. Notification Status Service
- Tracks delivery status across all channels
- Provides unified status reporting
- Manages retry logic and failure handling

#### 5. AWS Infrastructure Services
- **Message Broker**: Amazon MSK (Managed Kafka) for high-throughput event streaming
- **Distributed Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) for preference caching and rate limiting
- **Databases**: 
  - Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for structured data
  - Amazon DynamoDB for high-throughput status tracking
- **Monitoring Stack**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Prometheus/Grafana on ECS



### Workflow

1. **Client** sends notification request to API Gateway
2. **Notification Gateway Service**:
   - Authenticates request
   - Checks rate limits
   - Retrieves user preferences
   - Publishes notification event to Kafka

3. **Channel Services** consume events based on priority:
   - Process notification based on channel-specific requirements
   - Call external provider APIs
   - Publish status events back to Kafka

4. **Status Service** aggregates delivery status from all channels

## 3. Data Models

### Notification Event
```json
{
  "notification_id": "uuid-123",
  "user_id": "user-456",
  "notification_type": "security_alert",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "content": {
    "title": "Suspicious Login",
    "body": "Login attempt from new location",
    "data": { "ip": "203.0.113.1" }
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-10-22T15:30:00Z",
  "idempotency_key": "sec-alert-789"
}
```


## 4. Key Features Implementation

### Priority-Based Processing
- **Critical**: Dedicated Kafka topic with highest resource allocation
- **High**: Processed within seconds, higher consumer count
- **Medium**: Standard processing, balanced resources
- **Low**: Batch processing for efficiency

### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Distributed rate limiting using Redis
- Multi-level throttling:
  - Per user limits
  - Per channel limits (SMS more restricted than email)
  - Global system limits

### Delivery Status Tracking
- Status events published to dedicated Kafka topic
- Statuses: ACCEPTED → PROCESSING → DELIVERED → READ
- Real-time status updates via WebSockets (optional)

### Retry Mechanism
- Exponential backoff strategy
- Channel-specific retry policies
- Dead letter queues for failed notifications

## 5. Scaling & Resilience

### Horizontal Scaling
- All services are stateless and horizontally scalable
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth and CPU utilization
- Kafka partitioning for parallel processing

### High Availability
- Services deployed across multiple availability zones
- Database replication for fault tolerance
- Circuit breakers for external provider failures

### Performance Optimizations
- Batching for non-critical notifications
- Connection pooling for external providers
- Caching of user preferences and templates


## 6. AWS Cloud Infrastructure & Monitoring

### AWS Services Deployment
- **Compute**: Amazon ECS/EKS for containerized microservices
- **Messaging**: Amazon MSK (Managed Kafka) for event streaming
- **Storage**: 
  - Amazon RDS for relational data (PostgreSQL)
  - Amazon DynamoDB for notification status tracking
  - Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) for caching and rate limiting
- **API Management**: Amazon API Gateway for client requests
- **Scaling**: AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic capacity management
- **Networking**: AWS VPC, ELB for secure network configuration

### Comprehensive Monitoring Stack
- **Amazon CloudWatch**:
  - Custom dashboards for service metrics
  - Logs aggregation and analysis
  - Alarm configuration for critical thresholds
  - Container insights for ECS/EKS monitoring
- **Prometheus & Grafana** (deployed on ECS):
  - Real-time metrics visualization
  - Custom dashboards for business KPIs:
    - Channel success rates
    - Delivery latency histograms
    - Queue depth monitoring
    - Provider availability status
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Audit and compliance monitoring

## 7. Advantages of Microservice Approach

- **Independent Scaling**: Scale busy services (like SMS) without scaling others
- **Technology Flexibility**: Use optimal tech stack for each service
- **Failure Isolation**: Issues in one channel don't affect others
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can own different services
- **Incremental Deployment**: Roll out new features per service

This microservice architecture provides a robust foundation for a multi-channel notification system that meets all requirements while allowing for future growth and adaptation.
